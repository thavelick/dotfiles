- Use qcopy and qpaste for copy/pasting to the user's clipboard. Works like pbcopy/pbpaste
- Use trashit instead of rm and rmdir for deleting files and directories. Moves items to trash for safety
- When asked to "merge", run `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` to merge with a merge commit and delete the remote and local branch
- User's GitHub username is @thavelick. When using personal pronouns (e.g., "on my behalf", "as me"), this is the identity to use.

## Workflow Rules
- When asked for information or explanation, do NOT implement changes unless explicitly asked. Answering a question is not permission to create scripts, modify config, or write code.
- For sequential multi-step workflows (e.g., commit then simplify, or plan then implement), complete each step fully before starting the next. Never run steps in parallel unless the user explicitly requests it.
